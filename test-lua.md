# Costly consequences of underinformed directors

How many *corporations* exist with directors **responsible** for
protecting a large portion of stakeholders' equity typically having so
little applicable experience or knowledge of their duties or legal
responsibilities?

We have all seen and read about consequences of failed governance of
community associations --- from petty irritations of hapless
administration of architectural rules preventing a homeowner from flying
a flag, to devastation of a community and lost lives resulting from
failure to conduct structural inspections and maintain adequate
reserves.

HOA managers and attorneys too often witness the dearth of volunteers
and the inordinate costs in time and funds wasted by HOA Boards
attempting to navigate issues affected by laws and best practices about
which directors are unaware --- and time and costs for recovering from
consequences of actions or inaction.

## Pool of qualified candidates varies with community size

Populations of most towns and cities usually are sufficient to enable
competitive elections and town- and city-councils with talents in
disciplines applicable to operating their governments. However, the
comparatively small population of most homeowners associations often
means a dearth of board candidates, many without applicable
qualifications. Often, HOA boards find themselves with directors with
virtually *no experience* in business, finance, insurance, law,
construction or many other applicable fields.

## HOAs with underqualified directors are the rule --- not the exception

HOA boards with under-qualified directors can have profound, negative
and costly effects on the lives of their members.

In my over forty-years of experience with HOAs I've found well-meaning
volunteers in a neighborhood setting tend to conduct meetings within a
social context wherein decisions are heavily influenced by uninformed
sensibilities and impulses of neighbors present, without due diligence
and investigation, consideration of state regulation or standards of
governance intended to protect broader interests.
